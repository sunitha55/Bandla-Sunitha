# Tandemloop Screening Test – Solutions  
### Submitted by: **Bandla Sunitha**

This repository contains my answers for the **Stage-1 Screening Test** given by **Tandemloop** as part of the Full Stack Developer hiring process.

I solved all four questions using **Java**, and each problem has been placed in a separate file as requested.

## 🧩 Problem Descriptions

### **Problem 1 – Calculator**
I created a simple calculator using a class.  
It can perform:
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  

File: **Problem1.java**

---

### **Problem 2 – Odd Number Series**
For a given number `a`, the program prints the first `a` odd numbers.

Example:  
`a = 4 → 1, 3, 5, 7`

File: **Problem2.java**

---

### **Problem 3 – Conditional Odd Sequence**
Here, the output depends on whether the input number `a` is even or odd.

- If `a` is **odd**, print first `a` odd numbers.  
- If `a` is **even**, print first `a-1` odd numbers.

File: **Problem3.java**

### **Problem 4 – Count Multiples**
Given the list:
[1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30]

The program counts how many values are multiples of numbers **1 through 9**.

Expected example output:

{1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}

File: **Problem-4.java**

## ▶️ Running the Programs

You can compile and run any file like this:
```bash
javac Problem1.java
java Problem1
Do the same for Problem2, Problem3, and Problem4.
